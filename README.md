# Business Card webapp

Ever wanted your own online business card?
You haven't had the time yet to develop it on your own or you don't know how to do it?
Then feel free to use this template application. It is developed in Svelte/Sapper and can be statically and cheap hosted e.g. with Google Firebase.

Check out my running website as example: https://lukasweichselbraun.com
